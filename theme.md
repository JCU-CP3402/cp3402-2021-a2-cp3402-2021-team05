The starter theme:
Our site's theme is made by editing a starter theme called Generic by Bryan Hadaway as a base. 

About Generic:
The initial theme is very simple has a very clean yet simple theme design. With a white background and shades of grey.
Links and posts were highlighted in blue. In terms of the layout we kept the general text on the right hand side and the 
blog posts on the left side of the page. A search bar was attached to the top-right of the page and a logo on the top
left side of the page. 

Editing:
We edited some of the colour scheme and the layout of the default text style of the theme. The header that was intially 
light grey was changed to black to have a contrast of colours and makes it more aesthetic rather than a full page that 
is simply white. We added a navigation bar at the top of the page and changed the spacing to make it more full, to fit
nicely on the header.Other than that the colour scheme was kept black and white. The text colours was changed from a full black
colour to a soft grey colour to in order to blend it with the background better. We added our own logo to the left of 
the header. We used relevant imagery heavily in the site to convey messages more than words. All designs were done 
in the style.css folder that can be found in the theme folder, that was where most of the major 
changes were made. On top of that, we used Wordpress's additional CSS option in the theme customization tab in 
order to make some quick adjustments, such as logo size and navbar font size.
