Our site is about a group called "Autism support group" which is based in Australia

To start off, When you simply want to add a normal contents page such as the home page, services page, or the "our team"
page, those pages generally are created as normal pages. As for blog posts, these are created within the posts section
of wordpress. Under the posts section, there are categories in which different blogs posts would fall under. In our 
case, we have autism research, Getting a job, going to school, and life stages. 

In the future, if more blog posts were to be made, they might fall under these existing categories and if so, you can 
create the post under it. If not, a new category can simply be made within the categories section under posts. As for 
plugins, we only used one plugin which was WPForms. This is where our registration form is made. if needed to get 
additional information from the user, they can easily be added through WPForms.

The website also comes with a wide range of media and illustrations that are placed in different pages and posts. These
media are provided by our client as well as open source stock image websites. To add those images, simply uploading to 
the built-in wordpress media library would suffice. By doing so, you can immediately input and place the picture in the 
website.
